          "description": "Welcome to the travel app that you have all been waiting for!\n\nThis is not one that is powered by clever AI algorithms. Nor is it one were users are permitted to upload hundreds of fake reviews.\n\nThe content for this app is provided entirely by our dedicated team of professional travel writers and reviewers.\n\nThe only thing that matters to us is you, the user. We want you to be able to trust what you read here. If an attraction falls below expectations, then we will be honest and say so. If a restaurant is not up to scratch, then we won’t include it.\n\nFake reviews cause a huge problem for both consumers and honest businesses. Consumers waste money on poor experiences. Honest businesses struggle against competitors who bolster their image with unfair coverage.\n\nYet most travel apps out there allow just this: misleading reviews that harm consumers and distort fair competition.\n\nAll of our content is 100% independent. Our researchers have visited every single place that we include within this app, often multiple times. We do not take any payment for favourable coverage.\n\nAll adverts are totally separate from editorial content. We will always indicate where content has been sponsored.\n\nWe want to be different. We believe that you want us to be too.",

As is usual with these kinds of places, you can sample the beer before you commit to a full pint.\n\nThe bar also offers a tasting selection – five small pours for €15. Besides beers, the bar offers cocktails, wine and tapas-style snacks. Non-alcoholic beer is available, too.\n\nThe beers being sold changes frequently. Many of them are Spanish, but there are some foreign imports as well.\n\nThere are two parts to the bar. The upstairs part, close to the bar, is fairly small, with most of the seating running alongside the serving counter. There is also another room downstairs.\n\nThe vibe might best be described as rocky hipster. Classic rock tracks play in the background.",

                "description": "Most producers of Spanish cava are located in the El Penedès region of Catalonia, which is about a 45-minute drive northwest of Barcelona. There are only a few cava wineries located elsewhere in Spain, so this is really the best place to come if you want to find out more about the history and tradition of Spain’s sparkling wine.\n\n**Getting there**\n\nGetting to the wineries is easy if you have car – although of course, if you do decide to drive yourself, you will then be limited to the amount of wine-tasting you can do .\n\nAn alternative way of exploring the region is to hire a car with a driver, although this is likely to be a more expensive option. You should mention what wineries you want to visit, and expected waiting time at each one, before you set off in order to negotiate a convenient price.\n\nYou can also take a train from Placa Catalunya to some cava wineries. The most popular station is Sant Sadurní d'Anoia train station, which is a short walk or a taxi ride to many of the wineries.\n\nThe final option is to join an organised tour. Several companies in Barcelona organise these. The Penedès Tourist Board provides details of tours that are available. It also offers advice of what else there is to do in the region, besides just sampling the local wine.\n\n**Why go?**\n\nEl Penedès is a picturesque area, with plenty of quaint towns that you can drive through or stop at. There are also some nice walks to be had here as well.\n\nNot all wineries in the region are open to the public, but it is not difficult to find those that do welcome visitors. They will usually have details of visiting times on their website, as well as any particular tours that they offer.\n\nSome of the popular wineries that you can visit in the region are Cordoniu, Freixenet, Recaredo, Vilarnau, Alta Alella, Llopart, Gramona, Castellroig. Check their websites for the latest details.\n\n**Eating options**\n\nThere are plenty of local eating options in the towns and villages that are spread throughout the region.\n\nA number of the wineries also offer some food along with the wine tasting - check their websites for details..\n\nTypical food from the region includes *Gall del Penedès* (rooster), *coques enramades* (flatbreads) and an endive salad served with cod, tuna, anchovies and a romanesco-style sauce known as *xató*.",

The journey into the region will take around 90 minutes, depending on traffic.\n\nIt is also possible to take a bus from the centre of Barcelona to Olot, the capital of the region. The bus leaves from near Plaça Catalunya, and the journey takes just over two hours. There are then some local buses that you can catch between towns.\n\n**Why go?**\n\nOne of the reasons that so many tourists come to this area is the spectacular hikes that it has to offer.\n\nIt is also very good horse riding country, and there are plenty of equestrian centres that offer trips around the national park.\n\nYou can also explore the area by bike - or even hot air balloon!\n\nYou will find some very well-preserved medieval villages here, with old bridges, churches, mills and castle ruins. Besalú is probably the most famous. It is very pretty, although it can get a little crowded during the summer months.\n\n**Other villages worth visiting are Santa Pau, Sant Joan les Fonts and Sant Feliu de Pallerols. All of these have tourist information centres in them.**\n\n**Eating options**\n\nIt is not difficult to find decent restaurants in the national park.\n\nYou will find many of these along the walking trails that thread through the region, great for stopping off at the end of a vigorous day’s hike.\n\nMake sure you plan ahead, though. During the peak season you will almost certainly have to book ahead, possibly days in advance.\n\nA traditional type of pasteurised goat’s cheese, known as Garrotxa cheese, is popular in the region.",

Montserrat literally means ‘serrated mountain’ – a tribute to the distinctive jagged peaks that can be seen as you approach.\n\n**Getting there**\n\nThe Monastery of Montserrat is about an hour’s drive away from the centre of Barcelona.\n\nThere are no tolls along the way, but be warned that the roads can get exceeding busy during weekends and on public holidays, especially if the weather is fine.\n\nIf you don’t arrive by 10am on such days, then you are likely to queue before you are allowed to enter the parking area.\n\nCar parking is not free. Expect to pay around €7 for the day if you have a small car (the price increases with the size of your vehicle). There are a few charge points for electric vehicles at the site.\n\nAnother popular way of getting to Montserrat is by train. The R5 train runs regularly from Plaça España to the foot of Montserrat (the journey time is just over one hour). From there you can decide to either take the rack railway or the cable car up to the top.\n\nYou can buy a combined ticket that includes both the train journey and the journey to the top of the mountain.\n\n**Why go?**\n\nOne of the reasons that Montserrat has become such a popular destination is the monastery of Santa Maria, which was originally founded in 1025. It was rebuilt in the 19th and 20th century, and is still actively used by around 70 monks.\n\nThis was one of the most important starting points for pilgrims who wanted to walk the Camino de Santiago, a 1000-mile route to another monastery in the west of the country.\n\nOne of the most famous artefacts within the monastery is that of the Black Madonna, which is believed to have been carved in Jerusalem at the beginning of Christianity. Black Madonnas can be found all over the world. This is one of the most famous.\n\n**Eating options**\n\nThere isn’t a great deal of choice about where to eat at the monastery, so you may want to bring your own packed lunch.\n\nDuring weekends there is usually an open air food market where you can buy local produce such as cheeses, olives and cold cuts. One traditional cheese that is widely sold in the market is mató de Montserrat, which has a similar texture to ricotta but with a milder taste. The cheese is often served with honey.\n\nThere is a large café at Montserrat, which serves reasonable coffee and decent sandwiches, plus other snacks and drinks. There is seating both inside and out. This is a nice place to relax, especially if you have just finished a hike.\n\nAlternatively, if you drive down the mountain, you will find a few towns that have some small eateries.",

Tickets can be purchased online, at ticket machines, or directly from the driver. You can pay in cash, but the driver may not always have the exact change to give you.\n\nThe buses run 24-hours a day, 365 days per year. They are comfortable and equipped with ample luggage storage. They also have free WiFi and USB charging plugs – although these plugs aren’t always working.\n\nBe very vigilant about your luggage. Thieves frequently target tourists arriving in the city!",

If you arrive at T2, follow the signs to the metro station located just outside.\n\nRegular metro tickets cannot be used to travel to and from the airport.

This works out as €1.30 per journey, and can take you anywhere on the public transport network.\n\nUnfortunately, only Terminal 2 is served by this train. Therefore, if you arrive at Terminal 1, you may find it more convenient to take alternative transportation, such as the metro or Aerobus.

It will be quite a bit more expensive if you don’t book in advance, however.\n\nFor shorter stays, the rates are also very convenient, and an hour’s parking should only cost a few euros.\n\nStays of 15 minutes or less are completely free at Express Parking.

                  "Barcelona is a sports-loving city, with **football** (soccer) being by far the most popular, thanks to its iconic FC Barcelona team. The team´s Camp Nou stadium is a major tourist attraction.\n\nOther popular sports include **basketball**, **tennis**, **cycling** and a range of **beach sports** (beach volleyball, windsurfing, paddelboarding, etc).\n\n**Motorsport**, particularly Formula 1, also has a strong following in the city.\n\n**Padel** is a popular racket sport in Spain, often described as a mix between tennis and squash. It is played on an enclosed court about a third of the size of a tennis court, and is typically played in doubles. The sport is easy to pick up, making it accessible to all ages and skill levels. There are numerous padel clubs and courts across the city. It will not be difficult to find one that you can play at."

Note that the ‘supermercat’ shops you see around town are little more than grocery stores, often selling basic products at highly-inflated prices.",
                  "**Mercadona**\n\nThese stores are generally fairly large. They sell a lot of ready-to-eat meals. The Spanish tortillas and croquettes are not bad.\n\nMost outlets have a small kitchen area with a microwave where you can heat up any meal that you have brought.\n\nMercadona stores tend to have a large meat section, along with a machine for slicing ham and other cold cuts. The chain is less strong on food and vegetables.\n\nIt is possible to order online and have home delivery, for a fee.",

The supermarket also runs regular offers.\n\nThe quality is a bit lower than other supermarkets (it is difficult to find decent fruit and vegetable here, for example), but much of the produce is not bad for the price. Cheese is decent.\n\nMost Lidl stores do not do deliveries, although there are some very rare exceptions (the branch in Santa Antoni, for instance).\n\nThe queues, especially in the centre of town, can often be quite long.",

Citizens of many other countries (including the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and Japan) may not stay longer in Spain or any other EU country for longer than 90 days within any 180-day period.",
                  "**NIE**\n\nA Foreigner Identification Number (known as a NIE) is vital for carrying out many legal and administrative tasks in the country, such as: working and paying taxes in Spain, buying or renting a property, opening a bank account, signing freelance contracts, enrolling in schools and universities and getting utilities connected.\n\nIf you are planning on staying in Barcelona for any length of time (rather than just visiting as a tourist), you really should try and get one. Unfortunately, while obtaining a NIE should be straightforward, it is extremely frustrating, largely because of the difficulty in obtaining an official appointment. Available appointment slots fill up extremely quickly, and sometimes there are none available at all for days and days.\n\nSome unofficial agencies can help overcome this bureaucratic hurdles (for a fee!), but we cannot endorse this approach since it is not strictly-speaking legal. If you book an appointment in this way, there is no guarantee that you will be seen.\n\nObtaining the appointment is the hard part. Once this is done, the process should be relatively smooth, providing that you bring all everything with you to the meeting (all completed forms, identification and the receipt showing that you have paid the required fee online).\n\nThere are three types of residency certificates.\n\nThe *NIE Verde* (Green Nie) is only available for EU citizens. It confirms legal residence and allows full rights to live and work in Spain. While the Green NIE is the preferred document to have when taking up residency in the country, because of the bureaucratic hurdles described above, many choose to get the White NIE instead (see below) and may never get the chance to switch over to the Green NIE.\n\nThe *NIE Blanco* (White NIE) is does not grant residency rights, but it does allow you to carry out many of the administrative tasks that you might need to do, such as renting a property or opening a bank account. This is often granted to non-EU citizens with business or personal interests in Spain.\n\nThe TIE - Foreign Identity Card - is the equivalent of the Green NIE for non-EU citizens. To obtain it, you have to apply for it while in Spain with a valid residency visa.\n\nIt will make your life easier if you manage to get a NIE from outside Spain, which you can do so via a Spanish consulate or embassy in your home country. This will only allow you to obtain a White NIE, however. The process is generally more organised and less in demand than within Spain, but it can still take several weeks depending on the consulate’s workload. You will need to submit form EX-15, a valid passport, a letter explaining your reason for needing the NIE and the relevant fee.",
                  "**Digital Nomad Visa**\n\nSpain offers a Digital Nomad Visa for those who wish to live in Spain while working remotely for non-Spanish companies.\n\nTo be eligible for the visa you must:\n\n- Be employed by or have a contract with a non-Spanish company, or be a freelancer with clients outside Spain\n- Earn at least €28,800 per year. The requirement is higher if you have a family to support.\n- Hold a university degree or have at least three years of professional experience.\n- Have a clean criminal record.\n- Obtain private health insurance valid in Spain.\n\nYou can apply for this visa at a Spanish consulate within your home country. If you are already in Spain, you can lodge an application directly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThis visa is valid for an initial period of one year. It can be extended up to 3 years, with the possibility of renewal."

These days it is possible to find bikinis in restaurants throughout Barcelona, although quite a few of these offer bikinis with other kinds of filling. This suggests that the definition of bikini may be changing, but for locals it is still the original ham-and-cheese toastie.",

                "description": "You don’t have to be a die-hard football fan to enjoy a visit to Barcelona’s iconic Spotify Camp Nou stadium.\n\nThe museum is beautifully put together, really bringing to life the history of the club and the triumphs that it has enjoyed over the years. The accompanying audio guide significantly adds to the overall experience.\n\nThe first room displays club memorabilia from the past hundred years or so - fascinating to see how things have changed through the ages.\n\nSubsequent rooms display various prizes and cups that the club has won, as well as a mosaic of football T-shirts (some are owned by the club, while others are on loan).\n\nThere is plenty of information about the current players at the club – both the men and the women – as well as a display dedicated to who may arguably be the most internationally renowned player to ever kick a ball around for the club: Lionel Messi.\n\nMessi, who is an Argentinian footballer, joined the club in 2000, when he was just 13. He made his competitive debut when he was 17, and continued playing at Barça until 2021.\n\nThe museum has a giant auditorium where you can see members of the Barcelona squad, projected onto a giant screen that runs all around the room, passing a ball between themselves. Even if you are not an avid football fan, the atmosphere in this room is electric.\n\nOutside, visitors can have a go at a penalty shootout against a robot goalkeeper (although this costs extra). This “robo keeper” is extremely tough to beat.\n\nThe entrance ticket to the museum also includes a visit to a “viewpoint”, where you can look at the ongoing construction of the new football stadium. Work began on the new and expanded stadium in 2022, and it is expected that the team will return to the stadium by the end of this year. The Barcelona team is currently playing home games at the Olympic Stadium in Montjuic.",

Weed is decriminalised for personal use in Barcelona, although it is still not fully legal.\n\nKnowing the origin of the museum helps visitors appreciate how it has been curated. The museum still feels very campaign-like, extolling the virtues of the drug and ridiculing the prudish propaganda against legalisation, which has persisted through the decades.\n\nNonetheless, the museum is very interesting to visit, with plenty of snippets of information to pick up along the way. \n\nThe museum also holds regular temporary exhibitions on the ground floor which are free of charge.\n\nJust as fascinating as the museum is the magnificent building in which it is housed. As you wander around the museum, make sure that you take in the high ceilings with their fine decorations, the elaborate staircases, the intricate ironwork on the window and door frames, the stunning fireplace in the living room.\n\nPalau Mornau was originally built in the 15th century for noble families to live in. It was extended and renovated in classic modernist style in the early 19th century, and renovated anew when the museum opened in 2012. ",

Just those three loud and colourful words – Big, Fun, Museum – are enough to make passersby stop and think: will the museum really be as “fun” as all the literature is saying it will be?\n\nOur verdict is that, yes, it is. Kids will certainly enjoy it, and most adults will find it quite interesting too.\n\nThe Big Fun Museum consists of eight separate attractions spread across three floors. There’s the Sweet Museum, for example, and the somewhat disturbing Museum of Madness. Each area consists of a series of well-designed displays, according to the theme, as well as some very interesting explanations. Learn, for example, all about the legend of the Moth-Man and the smallest woman that ever lived.\n\nMuch of the museum is suitable for children from the age of four, but certain areas may be quite scary for very young kids.\n\nGiant’s House, Topsy-Turvy House, the Sweet Museum and Alice Through the Looking Glass can all be enjoyed by the younger members of your family.\n\nParts of Records and Wonders and the Madness Museum are more suitable for older children, from the age of seven or eight.\n\nThe Madness Museum has an age recommendation of 12. Some of the animations in the Magic Room – such as the dancing skeletons – can be a little frightening, too.",

It is this stone façade that gives the building its popular nickname, La Pedrera, which means ‘The Quarry’ in Catalan.\n\nInside is just as one might expect from Gaudí’s modernist period. Each room is uniquely designed, taking inspiration from the natural world and intended to be as light and airy as possible.\n\nThe attic is a particularly unique feature of the building, with 270 brick arches made to resemble the inside of a whale’s stomach. On fine days the rooftop is also highly worth visiting, offering fabulous views over the city. The stone chimneys look like armies of soldiers protecting the city, which is what inspired Catalan poet Pere Gimferrer to call the rooftop the Garden of Warriors – a name that appears to have stuck.\n\nThe free audio guide adds to the experience, with clear and engaging descriptions that transport the visitor into the architect’s mind. The commentary is related in the first person, as though it is Gaudí speaking about the building he created. A particularly nice feature of the audio is how the narration changes based on the room that the visitor is in. As soon as the visitor is out of a particular area, the audio will switch automatically to another track.\n\nCasa Milà was originally commissioned by Roser Segimón and Pere Milà. Segimón was the wealthy widow of a former colonist who made his fortune with a coffee plantation in Guatemala.\n\nThe building was declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1984.",

It is based on a type of architecture known as Mudéjar, which was popular across the Iberian peninsula between the 13th and 16th centuries. Gaudi also embraced oriental and neoclassical elements into the building’s design.\n\nWhile the building is perhaps less ostentatious than some of Gaudi’s other works, it is arguably one of his most important ones since it exhibits features that appear in his later modernist masterpieces. Vicens’s house also tends to be less crowded than many other more popular Gaudi buildings.\n\nFloral and geometric patterns dominate the interior of the house. The original project had a large garden area, in addition to the house, but over time the land was subdivided and sold for the construction of residential buildings. Nowadays, the property has been reduced to the house and a small surrounding area.\n\nHalfway through the house there is an informative video explaining its history. The video loops in Catalan, Spanish, and English. The excellent audio guide also helps to bring the place to life.",

This is not a place to come if you are searching for erotic titillation. Rather, the curated displays take visitors on a captivating historical journey of humanity’s relationship with sex through the ages, featuring such highlights as the distinctly uncomfortable-looking ‘pleasure chair’ and the erotic film collection of former Spanish King Alfonso XIII.\n\nThroughout the 14 rooms, visitors are offered an insight into how sex has been perceived by different cultures over the centuries, learning which civilisations were the most enlightened (the Romans, apparently) and which civilisations were less tolerant.\n\nThe authentic artefacts in the museum (such as the weird and wonderful pleasure devices invented over the years) bring the place to life, while the fascinating descriptions pinned to the walls are certain to leave a lasting impression on visitors’ minds.\n\nThe museum is not particularly big, but you can easily spend an hour or two getting lost in all that it has to offer.",

Fascinating explanations of each culture are peppered throughout (in English, Spanish and Catalan).

It is not one that is likely to be on the must-see list of most visitors to Barcelona, and yet ambling through the great halls of the museum, which are spread over four floors, is an unforgettable experience.\n\nFrederic Marès was an artist and sculptor who, during his extensive lifetime (he lived to be nearly one hundred, dying in 1991) collected an enormous array of Hispanic sculptures from the ancient world up until the 19th century.\n \nThe ground floor and the basement are taken up with wooden and stone sculptures throughout the ages, mostly of biblical scenes and figures. There are few explanations to go with them, beyond the rough period in which they were fashioned, but it is extremely fascinating to wander through the halls, marvelling at the differences between the carvings and seeing how these change through the ages.\n\nThe sculpture collection on these two floors is vast, but there are many more wonders to behold on the upper floors as well.\n\nOn the second floor you will find the Collector’s Cabinet, showcasing tens of thousands of objects that take visitors on a journey into past lifestyles and customs by documenting what people used to collect: fans, clocks, cameras, theatre tickets and many other trinkets besides. “Jaw dropping” is the word that springs most readily to mind.\n\nThe collections just go on and on. Thousands upon thousands of items, all huddled together in different categories, waiting to capture the visitor’s imagination. It is just a shame that they are so poorly labelled; you need to use your imagination to figure out what tales these items tell of ages gone by.\n\nAnd the museum doesn’t stop there! The collections continue on the uppermost floor as well, with a section dedicated to memorabilia from the performing arts.\n\nThe building in which the museum is housed is impressive, too: a complex of historical edifices that once served as residences for the various counts of Barcelona and the kings of Aragon. This is where the Spanish Inquisition once had its regional headquarters.\n\nTake a moment to look around the courtyard and the famous steps leading out of the complex... and breathe in the history.",

                "description": "Joan Miró was a Catalan painter and sculptor born in the late 1890s. While he is widely regarded as a surrealist artist, contemporary critics have emphasised his more personal style, borrowing elements from Fauvism and Expressionism. This is a point strongly re-enforced by a visit to the Joan Miró Foundation, where the works on display highlight a wonderfully diverse career over many decades. The artist died in 1983 and was painting right up to his death!\n\nThe museum is relatively big and one can easily spend a couple of hours getting lost in the works of Miró and his contemporaries. The building is airy and very well-lit – the perfect conditions under which to appreciate such art.\n\nAnd the views are fantastic! Right on the edge of Montjuic Park, the art gallery offers visitors the panoramic splendour of the whole of Barcelona – with Tibidabo winking in the distance. If you’ve got extra time, why not take a stroll around the very pleasant Jardins de Laribal just outside?\n\nMost of the museum is taken up with a permanent display, showcasing the various works of Miró over the years. Many of these works were donated to the museum by Miró or his wife.\n.\nThe museum also hosts regular temporary exhibitions, which are usually linked in some way to surrealism or other forms of modern art.\n\nThe artworks are mostly indoors, but there are some pieces (especially in the temporary exhibitions) housed outside. This allows visitors to appreciate the art while absorbing the breathtaking views at the same time.\n\nThe museum first opened its doors in June 1975, just months before the death of Spain’s dictator Francisco Franco. Like other Catalan artists of his time, Miró had long used artistic expression to oppose Francoist repression, but few such art galleries were welcomed under Franco’s rule.\n\nThere is also a reasonably-priced café attached to the museum, where you can grab a drink and bite to eat – and, yes, take in those fabulous views once more.

Visitors can walk all the way around the ship, really getting a sense of how vast the vessel was. The original craft was 60 meters long, with a depth of just over two metres. It was powered by 59 oars and the strength of 236 rowers. Truly striking. It is also possible to see the ship from above.\n\nThe building is very impressive, too.",

It is also a vital part of the city’s colourful history, having been the setting for numerous bloody episodes throughout its 400-year history.\n\n“This fortress is to Barcelona what the Bastille was to Paris or the Peter and Paul Fortress to Saint Petersburg,” wrote journalist Joseph Kessel of the castle in 1956.\n\nMontjuic Castle has been used to bombard the city of Barcelona on a number of occasions, brutally suppressing popular uprisings and revolts. One of the most famous periods for this was between 1842 and 1856, when growing tension with Madrid – as well as economic hardship – saw multiple attempts to topple the regional government.\n\nDefinitely come for the views. You can take these in without even buying a ticket: the perimeter of the castle is free to explore.\n\nIf you enjoy history, it is certainly worth venturing inside the buiding as well. There are a series of museums and galleries within the structure. Some of these are permanent, documenting the history of the castle in an engaging and informative way. Others are temporary, and likely to change from time to time.\n\nThere is a small cafeteria and an ice-cream truck in the castle’s courtyard. If the weather is fine, it is lovely to sit here and relax in the sunshine. Prices are reasonable.",

Those that are likely to be offended to not have to view the works of art on display, but for others visiting the museum offers a fascinating glimpse into the power that art has to challenge one’s belief and perceptions.\n\n*When we visited the museum, some former members of staff were protesting outside about the working conditions within the museum. The museum’s management say that they do not work at the museum. This is true. They work for another company, which the museum recently terminated a contract with. The protestors are claiming unfair dismissal, which the museum is contesting. Legal proceedings are ongoing.*",

The best way to visit the museum is to focus on those areas that you are most interested in, and then spend more time delving into these.\n\nThe information plaques scattered throughout the museum can feel a bit dry at times, especially if you don’t know a period particularly well, but models throughout the museum really help bring things to life: the knight on horseback, the longboat carrying goods to trade, the replica of an irrigation system for nourishing crops.\n\nThe museum is spread over three floors.\n\nThe first floor is given over to a temporary exhibition, which changes every few months or so. The second floor deals with Catalan history from the prehistoric period right up until the start of the 18th century. The top floor charts the course of history in the 18th and 19th century, right up to the present day.\n\nThere are separate tickets for the temporary and the permanent exhibition, or you can buy a combined ticket.\n\nThere is a sense that the museum rather glosses over the modern part of Catalan history, from the second half of the last century up to the present day. There is astonishingly little about the Franco era, for instance. This is a bit of shame, given the importance of this period in shaping Catalonia’s identity.\n\nMost of the information is in English, but some of the smaller displays are only labelled in Spanish and Catalan.",

While the museum is certainly worth visiting for anyone who likes Pablo Picasso’s paintings and those of his contemporaries, the relentless crowds can make appreciating the artwork in all its glory somewhat challenging.\n\nThe museum is divided into three parts.\n\nThe first part, shortly after the entrance, exhibits paintings from Catalan artists that lived and worked at the same time as Picasso. People like Santiago Rusiñol, Miquel Utrillo, Enric Clarassó and Ramon Canudas.\n\nThe second part of the museum covers Picasso’s early works, including his so-called “blue period”, where the artist divided his time between Spain and Paris.\n\nThe third part of the museum delves into his later cubist and neoclassical phase.\n\nThere is also a small exhibition on the work that the artist did with pottery.\n\nIt is a very interesting and well put-together museum. The visitor comes away with an awesome sense of what Picasso was able to achieve in his generous lifetime. There is also an audio guide that adds additional layers of colour to the museum, but this costs extra.\n\nOn especially busy days tickets for the Picasso Museum can be sold out. You can reserve tickets in advance online.\n\nThe museum also offers a limited number of tickets for \"free admission days\". Check the website for details.",

Tàpies himself was particularly drawn to surrealism, and used art as a way of conveying his dislike of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. A Catalan through and through, he used his art to keep the regional culture alive.\n\nThe well-lit museum covers three floors (plus a terrace), but the works of art are fairly spread out, meaning that you should need no more than an hour to appreciate everything.\n\nExhibitions run throughout the year and are usually based around the works of a particular artist. They change every six months or so. As one might expect for a museum bearing his name, the works of Tàpies appear regularly.\n\nMost exhibitions are accompanied by an audio guide, which can be downloaded onto the phone and listened to at leisure. These guides are extremely informative and well put together.\n\nThe museum is housed in the former headquarters of the Editorial Montaner y Simón publishing house. The building, completed in the early 1880s, is representative of early Catalan Modernism. The structure was ahead of its time, using brick and iron to create particularly large and airy rooms.\n.\nThe museum´s library contains a huge catalogue of documents and books pertaining to Tàpies, as well as other literature about contemporary art and architecture.

Many Chinese restaurants in Barcelona serve bao buns that are too heavy or have a cardboard texture, so it is refreshing to find ones that are so good.\n\nThe gyoza are excellent, too: freshly prepared right on the counter.\n\nIn fact, there’s not a dish that we wouldn’t recommend. Definitely give the noodle dishes a try – highly flavoursome.\n\nPrices are reasonable, though unfortunately portions are a little small. Still, it’s nice to order a few to share - you can always order more if you are still hungry!\n\nThe place isn’t hug, perhaps no more than half a dozen tables inside and a couple that are outside.\n\nStaff are friendly and have a smattering of English.\n\nThis is a very good place for take-away, too.",

The parmigiana di melanzane as a starter is very good.\n\nThe service of the restaurant leaves a little bit to be desired, however.

Vintage wine bottles line the shelves. Dim lighting sets a relaxed, intimate mood.\n\nLa Palma first opened as a grocery store in 1935, but five years later became a winery, as well as a meeting point for the intellectuals of the day. The bar is now owned by Albert Rial and Judith Giménez, who have pledged to uphold the local tradition that has made the place so well-known.\n\nThe place isn’t terribly big so it is definitely worth booking in advance. Menus are available in English, Spanish and Catalan.\n\nWhile there is a good selection of drink on offer (including, beer, wine and spirits), a lot of people come here to sample the homemade vermut. This really is excellent: subtly-spiced and not overbearing.\n\nFood is traditionally Catalan. Try the slow cooked pork, the cannelloni with truffle and the mussels. Although the restaurant offers a menu of the day, this is mostly aimed at locals in search of a quick and affordable lunch. We recommend ordering à la carte.",

They have two bottles of white available at the bar, plus a bottle of bubbly. Besides their own wine, they also offer a carefully-selected range of wine from other producers – so if you feel like exploring Catalan vintages this is a good place to try.\nThe food might be best described as authentic Catalan fare with a stylish twist: baby squid in a sumptuous white bean broth, grilled leek with a citrus and agave vinaigrette, patatas bravas topped with a parsley-aioli fusion. The duck croquette comes highly recommended. Definitely a place to return to.",

However, lunch often does require booking in advance, especially at weekends, and especially if you want to find a sunny spot on the terrace (which most people usually do).\n\nThis is the perfect place to incorporate into a hike – either with a breakfast before you set off, or with a lunch in the middle / at the end.\n\nThere is ample space for parking at the restaurant, too.",

This is a traditional Mexican dessert that closely resembles the crema catalana with one important difference – it is made with corn. Very distinctive.\n\nThe restaurant also serves a good range of cocktails, including a few traditional Mexican ones, such as spicy micheladas (tomato juice, a dash of lime, a splash of hot sauce and plenty of beer).\n\nThis is definitely the place to come if you are after more than your usual run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant.

Service is friendly, and staff are always eager to offer advice as to which ice-cream suits your taste. You can have a small taster of any flavour before you make your final decision.\n\nThe place has many of the classic varieties, as well as some more exotic ones. Unfortunately, these more interesting flavours, which are labelled in gold, cost quite a bit extra on top of the standard price - a common practice in Barcelona, where ingredients may be more expensive.\n\nThere are two varieties of pistachio for instance: regular pistachio and roasted pistachio from Iran. The roasted pistachio has a much more intense flavour, but one has to weigh up whether this really justifies the significantly higher price.\n\nOther premium-priced flavours that could be worth trying include piña colada, campari and orange, hibiscus margarita and kumquat. The alcoholic flavours have real alcohol in them, too!\n\nThe interior of the store is modern and minimalist. It’s take-away only.",

The food is deliciously inventive and the price, for a five-star eating experience, not at all unreasonable. The tasting menu consists of 14 elegant dishes, each assigned to a particular category: fish, poultry, red meat, vegetables and dessert to finish with. The whole tasting menu is pre-prepared, so the only decision you need to make throughout the entire meal is what wine to order.\n\nAlmost all the dishes at L'Antiquari Gastronomic are excellent. Clear stars are duck cannelloni (created in the memory of the chef’s grandmother) and a bisque made from gambero rosso, an Italian shrimp. The restaurant changes most of the dishes on the menu every month, but thankfully these two dishes remain.\n\nThe restaurant has an elegant intimacy to it, with soft music and low lighting. Service is excellent, with the dishes arriving at a decent pace: serenely unhurried, allowing ample time for conversation between plates but not leaving diners wondering what has happened to the rest of the meal.\n\nDon’t forget to book ahead if you are planning to come here for a special occasion. The place is usually full for weeks in advance.\n\nOne odd point about this restaurant is that it is located on the second floor and the entrance is via another restaurant.\n\nTake care: the floor of l’Antiquari Gastronòmic can be slippery!",

The frittatina and crocche antipasti are delicious and authentic, too. The restaurant has a large selection of classic Neapolitan desserts, such as tiramisu (you can get a traditional one, but also a delicious pistachio version and one made with pan di stelle), babá au rhum, pastiera and delizia al limone.\n\nThere is one caveat to this entry, however. A few years ago, the quality was better. It has dipped slightly and we’re not sure why.
